Puzzle pieces provided by https://www.reddit.com/r/StuffMadeHere/comments/zaq7f7/puzzle_piece_raw_image_dataset/

Steps:
* read image DONE
* compute contours DONE
* compute pieces DONE
  assert size and number of pieces?
* rotate pieces DONE
* compute likely borders DONE
* compute 4 corners DONE
  assert corners?
* compute 4 edge contour DONE
* compute 4 edge metadatas DONE
  assert number of corner&border&regular pieces DONE
* compute puzzle size DONE
* assemble border pieces => compute mask along the edge?
* assemble inner pieces

TODO:
* more precise corner detection with HoughLines intersection around the corners
* test with a more difficult dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/etaifour/jigsawpuzzle
